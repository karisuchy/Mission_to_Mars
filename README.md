# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview
For this project, I built an app that scrapes different websites for data pertaining to a Mission to Mars and then built an accompanying webpage to display the findings. This was accomplished by using the following resources:  

-	Chrome Developer Tools identified the HTML components that were used to find content for web scraping.
-	Jupyter Notebook/Python script that used Splinter to automate web browsers and BeautifulSoup to web scrape (extract) the data. 
-	MongoDB to create a database to store the data from the web scrape.
-	VS Code to design a Flask application to display the data.

## Resources
- Data Sources: NASA news https://mars.nasa.gov/news website; Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Space Images https://spaceimages-mars.com/ website; Galaxy Facts https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/ website; USGS hemisphere images https://www.usgs.gov/centers/astrogeology-science-center website
- Software: Python 3.7, VS Studio Code 1.62.3, Jupyter 6.3.0, MongoDB, Flask, Bootstrap, Beautiful Soup, Splinter 

## Results

The website allows users to get the latest news by just clicking a button to "Scrape New Data".

The web page also displays enhanced hemisphere views of the "Red Planet" planet.

## Summary
The final version of the website contains the latest news, a featured image, a mars fact table, and enhanced views of all 4 hemispheres. This webpage can be viewed on computers, tablets, and cell phones.
