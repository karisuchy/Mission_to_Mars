# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview
For this project, I built an app that scrapes different websites for data pertaining to a Mission to Mars and then built an accompanying HTML page to display the findings. This was accomplished by using the following resources:  

-	Chrome Develoloper Tools identified the HTML components that were used to find content for web scraping.
-	Python script that used Splinter to automate web browsers and BeautifulSoup to web scrape (extract) the data. 
-	MongoDB to create a database to store the data from the web scrape.
-	Flask to create a web application to display the data.
-	Bootstrap to create a HTML/CSS portfolio.

## Resources
Data: https://mars.nasa.gov/news, 
Software: Chrome Developer Tools, MongoDB, Flask, Bootstrap, Beautiful Soup, Spliter, Web_Driver Manager, 

## Results


## Summary
The app scans webistes for new data with just a click of a button.
